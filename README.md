# React Todo Bulma

Full-Stack To-Do list web app created with React in the frontend and a Rest API created with NodeJs on the backend with MongoLab acting as database.

## Motivation

This app was created to serve as an example to a tutorial series of 3 articles that was published on a [brazilian medium page](https://medium.com/trainingcenter/construindo-uma-aplica%C3%A7%C3%A3o-full-stack-com-react-c1a64db6fc94?source=friends_link&sk=ae6f3bc0ab13a58dbf5b2834843e5712).

## Getting Started

1. The first thing is to download all the npm packages through `npm install`.
2. Add the enviroment variable `MONGO_DB_URI` passing the MongoDB URI that was generated by MongoLab.
3. With that you can start your development server with `npm run start`.

### Prerequisites

This app was developed with having a mongodb database hosted on mongoLab, so if you want to follow this you should have an mongoLab account and a database inside to connect with.
